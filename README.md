# Research-Data-Visualization

This repository contains Python scripts and CSV datasets for visualizing survey data on ChatGPT usage in writing among high school and college students. Intended for a 25 page research paper I completed. Charts are built with matplotlib.





**NOTE: Each script uses a hardcoded CSV file path. Code is not meant for running, just a representation of the code used for the charts made for the paper.**
